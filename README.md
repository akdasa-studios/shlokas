# Shlokas
Learn Vedic verses to spiritualize your mind! This app is a collection of shlokas from the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and other spiritual texts. The app is designed to help you learn the verses by heart. It is also a great way to learn Sanskrit. Shlokas uses an interval repetition algorithm to help you learn the verses. So you can learn several verses a day.
